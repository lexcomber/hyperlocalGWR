# Hyper-local GWR
The code and data in this repository are for the GW-ELNR simulation study described in the _Journal of Journal of Spatial
Information Science_ submission. The code is described in the file `Comber_hyperlocal.R`. To run the simulation data you will need to download the zip file from this repository and unzip the files to a directory of your choice. This should then be set as the working directory in R using the `setwd()` function. 

Please contact Lex Comber [a.comber@leeds.ac.uk](a.comber@leeds.ac.uk) if you have any questions.
